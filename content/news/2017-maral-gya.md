Global Young Academy is a prominent organization that brings together excellent young scientists from around the world, 
raises the visibility of early-career scientists and empowers them to address global issues and to lead international, 
interdisciplinary, and intergenerational dialogue. 

The Global Young Academy aims to become the voice of young scientists around the world. Beside becoming involved in the ongoing project themes at GYA which revolves around science and society, 
Dr Dadvar proposed a new theme which will explore and introduce alternative parameters for evaluating professional achievements. She believes that achievements can be a path that one has accomplished and not only the destination that one has reached.

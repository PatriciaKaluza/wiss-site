The project proposal "Japanese Visual Media Graph" got accepted for funding by the German Science Foundation (DFG).
<!--more-->

Goal of the project is the creation of a consolidated graph-based database on all types of Japanese visual media, specifically manga, anime and chracter-driven computer games like visual novels. Data models and retrieval functions will be modelled to conform to the requirements of researchers from the fields of Japan studies or media science.
Partners are the [Leipzig University Library](http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de) and the [Leipzig University Department of Japan Studies](http://japanologie.gko.uni-leipzig.de/).

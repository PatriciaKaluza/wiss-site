---
We are very happy that our project proposal for a free and open citation database got accepted for funding by the German Science Foundation (DFG).
<!--more-->
The LOC-DB project will develop ready-to-use tools and processes based on the linked-data-technology that make it possible for a single library to meaningfully contribute to an open, distributed infrastructure for cataloguing of citations. Partners are the [Mannheim University Library](http://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de), the [German National Library of Economics (ZBW)](http://www.zbw.eu), and the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](http://www.dfki.de).

title: "Workshop on Linked Open Citations"
---
On November 6th, 2018, there will be the second public workshop where we present the results of our DFG funded "Linked Open Citations Database" project.
<!--more-->

The central idea of the project is the creation of a complete and open database of citations. We therefor develop a software that integrates the fortunately already available citation data and complements it semi-automatically by extracting information from PDFs and OCRed scans.

The goal is to make this process efficient enough to enable the collaborative creation and curation of this database within libraries.

At this workshop, we will present the current state of the project and discuss the relevance of this data for libraries and the sciences in general. Further information and a link to the free registration is here:

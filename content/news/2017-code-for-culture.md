---
With 25 students, we participate in the [Code for Culture](https://innovation.mfg.de/de/standort/kreativwirtschaft/digitale-kultur/code-for-culture-spielkultur-trifft-kulturspiel-1.47091) GameJam.
<!--more-->
The GameJam takes place from June 16-18 at the [shackspace Stuttgart](http://shackspace.de/shackspace.de/index.php).

3 days and 2 nights are dedicated to the development of (serious) games based on cultural heritage data and metadata from various galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM). Serious games, "Games with a purpose" or Gamification are concepts that combine a game or elements of a game with purpose, for example to motivate people to explore and learn or to improve a process.

Our students are from four different study courses (information design, online media management, computer science, and information science) and will form multidisciplinary teams with the other participants of the game jam.

The best contributions will be awarded at the [Open! Conference for Digital Innovation](http://www.openkonferenz.de/) 2017.

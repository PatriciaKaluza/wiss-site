# Dr.-Ing. Thomas Hartmann, M.Sc. (TUM)

Thomas Hartmann studied information systems and holds degrees in Computer
Science from TU Munich (M.Sc.)  and KIT Karlsruhe (PhD).

His research topic is all about RDF validation. He investigates how to validate any
RDF constraints (formulated by arbitrary constraint languages) and how to 
express them generically. He presented his work at international conferences and
workshops (e.g. WWW, ISWC, DC, and Dagstuhl seminars). Thomas Hartmann is
member of the RDF Vocabularies Working Group of the DDI Alliance, part of
the editorial board of the DCMI RDF Application Profiles Task Group, 
editor of the specifications DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary (Disco) and Physical
Data Description (PHDD), and contributes to the W3C RDF Data Shapes
Working Group.
